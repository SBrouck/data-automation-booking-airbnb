Automated pipeline for consolidating Airbnb and Booking.com reservation data into a unified Excel report. Combines past revenue exports with future iCal-based calendars, enabling streamlined reporting and analytics for short-term rental businesses.
# Rental Data Pipeline

This project automates the collection, cleaning, and consolidation of short-term rental data from Airbnb and Booking.com into a unified Excel report.  
It combines historical reservation exports with up-to-date future bookings extracted from public iCal calendar links, enabling structured reporting and deeper performance analysis.

## üåç Real-world context

This workflow was initially developed as part of my personal work while managing data for an international real estate portfolio worth ‚Ç¨50M.  
It allowed me to significantly reduce manual data handling and streamline weekly reporting across multiple rental platforms.

## üì¶ What it does

- Parses and cleans Airbnb exports (Excel format)
- Parses and cleans Booking.com exports (CSV format)
- Pulls real-time future reservations from Airbnb iCal calendar URLs
- Merges all data into one Excel file with two sheets:
  - `Revenus_pass√©s`: all past reservations from both platforms, sorry for the french words :)
  - `Calendrier_a_venir`: upcoming bookings pulled from iCal

## üöÄ How to use it (via Google Colab)
